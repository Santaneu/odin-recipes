    <p>There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies.</p>
   <p> Number one: Don’t use chips; instead, opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks.</p>
    <p> The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor.</p>
    <p>Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time.</p>
    <p>And that’s it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that’s textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!</p>
