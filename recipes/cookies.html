    <p>There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies.</p>
   <p> Number one: Don’t use chips; instead, opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks.</p>
    <p> The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor.</p>
    <p>Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time.</p>
    <p>And that’s it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that’s textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>for 12 cookies</p>
    <ul>

     <li>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)</li>
     <li> ¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed</li>
     <li> teaspoon salt</li>
     <li>½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted</Li>
     <li>1 egg</1i>
     <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     <li> ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)</li>
     <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
     <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)</li>
     <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
     <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
     <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
     <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
     </li>
     <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</Li>
     <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
     </1i>
     <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
     </li>
     <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. </li>
     <li>Cool completely before serving.
     </li>
     <li>Enjoy!</li>
    

    </ol>
